# autopet-oncology-generalizability
In this work, we used the PET/CT training data provided in the [autoPET 2022](https://autopet.grand-challenge.org/) challenge. We only utlized the PET/CT images with lymphoma (n=145), lung-cancer (n=168) and melanoma (n=188) pathologies for training our U-Net based deep neural network (no healthy control patients images were used from the autoPET dataset).
